# VorroaMiteCounter
Count the number of vorroa mites on a sticky board from a photo.
Bee keepers need to monitor vorroa mites, but it's time consuming to count the mites.
This program lets the bee keeper snap a photo of a sticky board or beetle trap in the field and then automated count of the mites.
It's quick and accurate that results in a marked up photo with the data on it.
This makes it easy to record hive inspection results.
